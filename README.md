# Developer in Test Coding exercise

Develop a test solution that automates some API tests.

The application under test is the GitHub Issues API v3: https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/

The scenarios to be covered are:

**Scenario 1: Create an Issue
Scenario 2: Edit an Issue title
Scenario 3: List issues for a repo, sorted by Update date**

* *Notes:
1.	* *Use of the GitHub API requires authentication:
a.	* *To simplify creation of an OAuth token, use the GitHub web UI (Developer Settings) to create a personal access token.
b.	Do not check in any secrets into the repo to be shared.
c.	Provide instructions for how to add a token locally so that your solution can be checked using another GitHub account.
2.	Make the name of the repo in which issues are to be created configurable, so that tests can be easily run against different repositories.* *

## Candidate Requirements

a.	Build a test project that includes automation of the 3 scenarios above.
a.	Solution to be coded in any language of choice
b.	Tests to be driven with any framework of choice
b.	Share code in a public GitHub repository for review.
c.	Share further improvements that could be considered, where relevant.
